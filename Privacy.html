Collection and Use of Personal Information
Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.
You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with UnicLog or a UnicLog affiliated organization. UnicLog and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.
</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information UnicLog may collect and how we may use it:
What personal information we collect</p>
<p>When you create a UnicLog account, purchase a product, download a software update, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we do not collect your private information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.</p>
<p>When you share your content with family and friends using UnicLog products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in UnicLog services or forums, UnicLog does not collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. UnicLog will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.</p>
<p>We do not ask for a government-issued ID in any circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.</p>
<p>How we use your personal information
We do not process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which UnicLog is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by UnicLog or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information. If you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer at help@wemake.cloud</p> 
<p>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on UnicLog’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.</p>
<p>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material. Where we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us. We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services. For certain online transactions, we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.</p>
<p>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with the identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use the date of birth to determine the age of UnicLog ID account holders.
From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with UnicLog, you may not opt-out of receiving these communications.</p>
<p>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve UnicLog’s products, services, and customer communications.</p>
<p>Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you
We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using UnicLog products, sent gift certificates, and products, or invited you to participate in UnicLog services or forums. We may also validate the information provided by you when creating a UnicLog ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.</p>
<p>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may or may not collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>
<p>We may or may not collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where a UnicLog product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.</p>
<p>We may or may not collect information regarding customer activities on our website, UnicLog, and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may or may not collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure the quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.</p>
<p>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.</p>
<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
<p>Cookies and Other Technologies
If you do not want your cookies to be tracked while using the UnicLog, you may use the Alpha Browser to protect your privacy. Alpha Browser does not track cookies. UnicLog’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>UnicLog also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with UnicLog more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the UnicLog Online Store. Knowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system and provide you with better customer service.</p> 
<p>Disclosure to Third Parties
At times UnicLog will not provide third parties. UnicLog does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Service Providers
UnicLog shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever UnicLog operates.</p>
<p>Others
It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for UnicLog to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. This could include providing information to public or governmental authorities. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.</p>
 
<p>Protection of Personal Information
UnicLog takes the security of your personal information very seriously. UnicLog online services such as UnicLog mobile app, uniclogglobal.org protect your personal information during transit using various forms of encryptions.
When you use some UnicLog products, services, or applications or post on a UnicLog forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.</p> 
<p>The Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling
UnicLog does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.
Children & Education</p>
<p>We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using UnicLog products and services. Minors under the age of 18 are not permitted to use UnicLog, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed UnicLog ID account (where available) through their school. </p>
<p>Location-Based Services
To provide location-based services on UnicLog products, UnicLog and our partners and licensees, such as maps data providers, may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your UnicLog computer or device. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by UnicLog and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. </p>
<p>Third‑Party Sites and Services
UnicLog websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third‑party app.
Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.
If you purchase a subscription in a third-party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence. If you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.</p>
<p>Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy
To make sure your privacy is protected, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to UnicLog employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.</p>
<p>Privacy Questions
If you have any questions or concerns about UnicLog’s Privacy Policy or data processing, you would like to contact our Data Protection Officer, or if you would like to make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, please contact us via email at help@wemake.cloud. 
UnicLog may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.
